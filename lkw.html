    The city has witnesses a radical growth along the Faizabad Road and State Highways, hence producing new localities on the real estate development map. Currently, the Lucknow’s real estate 
    market is buyer’s market. In New Lucknow, the participation of investors is approximately 40%, it is expected to escalate in the future. The real estate market is driven by the bureaucrats,
     politicians, public/government servants, emerging IT/ITeS industry in the city due to good infrastructure, planned development in some localities, and good connectivity and original 
    inhabitants of Lucknow who have now migrated outside. During the FY 2011-12, the average price appreciation in certain localities has been in the range of 8 – 15 %, which shows stability 
    with a slight upward bias.
    <br><br>
    Various mega projects with world class social amenities by reputed private developers (DLF, Rohtas, Eldeco, Halwasiya, Emaar MGF, Ansals, Unitech and Sahara) are changing the face of
     residential real estate in the city. Compared to other metropolitan cities, land is available at affordable price, this has led private developers to venture into the market.
